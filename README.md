The objective of our final project is to design an Autonomous Delivery Robot capable of identifying objects in its environment, and navigate through indoor surroundings to deliver a requested item. The robot will be based on a Differential Drive System, using two independently controlled motors and two caster wheels for support. Each motor will implement an attached encoder as feedback for a PID controller to move in a straight motion. To identify objects, an array of ultrasonic sensors will be used on the front, left, and right sides. The sensors will communicate feedback for various object avoidance and wall-following algorithms. Radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags will be assigned to individual rooms. These tags will provide location feedback to the robot in reference to the desired room of delivery. To implement user interaction, a Graphical User Interface (GUI) will act as the main communication system of the robot. The GUI will notify the robot of what action to perform as well as provide basic security features; sending SMS text messages to the user necessary information to properly receive the requested item.
